# 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon



##  Description

As a Cinephile, also called “movie lover”, I want to be presented with a random actor, so that I can then connect that actor to another based on a movie both have performed in, continuing that process with each consecutive actor until I have a chain of connections leading to Kevin Bacon. 

Javascript is our main technology used, along with HTML and CSS. Bulma was used for adding styles to the page. Foundation modals were generated within Javascript adding styling with Bulma. Learning a new CSS framework and merging conflicts the first time were the biggest challenge we faced, and we overcame by reading more documents and testing on the website to get the CSS style works as well as communicating throughout the whole project solved the merge conflicts efficiently.
